#Next we will want to see what the SQL alchemy 
#SQL queries actually are


#A drawback with SQL Alchemy is that
#If the DB server already has a table with that name
#Even if we make modifications of the model
#It won't apply those to the table
#So,This is one drawback
#So we need something called Alembic to handle these migrations


#Now we will delete our posts table from PGAdmin 
#And try to create that using the ORMs

    
#ORMs are object relational mappers which are used to 
#use Python code instead of SQL to interact with the DB
#Examples involve SQLAlchemy
#SQL Alchemy inturn needs psycopg2 to connect to the database
#Let's implement this additional layer of abstraction


#post with ID in error message it is also vulnerable to a SQL injection
#So,Fix that

#Execute's second parameter accepts tuple as the second parameter so just add
#a comma after that "id"

#Now we will implement the createPosts function using SQL queries



#Now we will implement the getPosts function
#Using SQL statements to get the posts from the database
#USing the cursor
#Which runs our queries


#Now the reconnection attempt might be way too fast
#So we need something to delay it a bit before attempting to reconnect
#So we'll import the time module and do that
#This would be a nice way of handling the internet disconnection or a similar
#issue

#We need to ensure that the database connection is established 
#And we need to wait till it is established and we cannot move on with the rest of
#the code if the connection is not properly established
#So throwing the error and starting the server anyway is of no use
#So we need to ensure that the connection is established
#SO we place the entire logic for the connnection to the database inside a while loop
#the while loop will go on indefinitely until we successfully 
#establish a connection and then we can break out of the loop

#We restructured our folders
#Kept everything inside of our app directory
#Now we can simply change the uvicorn thing
#to refer to this package
# uvicorn app.main:app --reload



#Python has a fancy word for folder -> packages
#and for a folder to become a package you need to add a __init__.py
#inside that
#Now we'll restructure our folders
#and put this file inside an app folder


#Beautiful
#we might not even need to use POSTMAN and we can just use swagger UI
#to test out our operations
#we also have something called redoc
#which has a different UI for trying out all these operations
#WE CAN GET A DOCUMENT POWERED BY REDOC

#We can click on TryItOut and execute to get it to execute the path operations
#we defined

#FastAPI has default swaggerUI SUPPORT
#FastAPI does all the documentation for you automatically
#You don't need to write a single line of code for that
#Which is pretty awesome
#It updates the documentation for your path operations by itself


#That's all about CRUD operations 
#They all work perfectly!!
#If not index apparently broke the update operation at index 0 
#So,Changed that to index==None


#Now we're going to create the Update post operation

#I'm not getting that error but 
#The basic idea is that when you're sending back a 204 you must not send back any 
#data
#However it is essential that with a 204 we don't send any data back
#So we need to send a response that follows this protocol


#Finally implemented a successful delete operation by id
# Now the standard for a successful deletion is 204
#So we need to update the default status code of our delete operation using
#the decorator


# https://youtu.be/0sOvCWFmrtA?t=7403
# fEELING EXTREMELY TIRED WILL implement the delete Post later
#Let's do that to the create posts
#Just add a 201 to the decorator itself
#Now the HTTP Error things is fixed
#However even for successful tasks there are defined HTTP responses
#Such as we should a get a 201 for a successful creation
#Let's see how to do that 

#This is a cool way
#But a better way is just throwing a FastAPI HTTP Exception


#Instead of remembering which HTTP code to use
#We can use a FastAPI library called status

#This is where order matters!


#Now I'll write a decorator and a path 
#That would retrieve the latest post for me

# Whenever we have a path parameter it will always be returned
# as as string
# so Make sure to typecast it before you use integral comparisions on it

#If we get a string passed and it cannot be converted to an integer
#By Itself then we use FastAPI to validate it for us
#And If possible it will convert it to an integer
